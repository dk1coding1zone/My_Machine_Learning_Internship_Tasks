1. List of critical parameters for the target variable. Why they are important?

Here are some parameters that could be considered critical:

Network Type: The type of network (3G, 4G, etc.) can affect call quality and stability. Different network technologies may have varying levels of coverage, bandwidth, and reliability, which can impact call drop rates.

Rating: The user rating given to the call experience reflects the overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the call quality. Higher ratings generally indicate better call quality, while lower ratings suggest issues that could lead to call drops.

Location (Latitude and Longitude): The geographical coordinates of the call's location can play a crucial role in call drop occurrences. Factors such as network coverage, signal strength, and infrastructure quality can vary based on the location, leading to differences in call reliability.

State Name: The state or region where the call is made can influence the call drop category. Different states may have varying levels of network infrastructure, population density, and network congestion, which can impact call quality.

These parameters are important because they provide insights into the factors that contribute to call drop occurrences. By analyzing and understanding the relationship between these parameters and the call drop category, it becomes possible to identify patterns, trends, and potential causes for call drops. This information can help telecommunication companies and service providers improve their network infrastructure, optimize coverage, and address specific issues in certain locations or network types to reduce call drop rates and enhance overall customer experience.


2. Write your conclusion/s of the project.

Based on the analysis of the dataset, which includes parameters such as network type, rating, location (latitude and longitude), and state name, we have drawn the following conclusions:

Call Drop Prediction: A logistic regression model was trained to predict the call drop category based on the given features. The model achieved a certain level of accuracy in predicting the call drop category using the provided dataset. However, the accuracy of the model may vary depending on the quality and representativeness of the data, as well as other factors such as feature selection and modeling approach. It is recommended to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data to assess its generalization capability.

Critical Parameters: Several critical parameters were identified that have a significant impact on call drop occurrences. These include network type, rating, location (latitude and longitude), and state name. These parameters provide valuable insights into the factors influencing call drop rates. By understanding the relationship between these parameters and call drops, telecommunication companies and service providers can take targeted measures to improve network infrastructure, coverage, and overall call quality.

Cluster Analysis: Further analysis using cluster analysis can be performed on different variables to identify patterns and group similar data points together. This can help in understanding the characteristics of different clusters and their relationship with call drop categories. Cluster analysis can provide additional insights into the factors influencing call drops and help in devising targeted strategies for improvement.

State-wise Segmentation: Segmentation of ratings by state can provide valuable insights into the variations in call quality across different regions. By analyzing state-wise ratings, telecommunication companies can identify states with higher satisfaction levels and those with lower ratings, enabling them to focus on improving call quality in areas where it is relatively poor.

In conclusion, this project provides a preliminary analysis of call drop categories based on various parameters. It highlights the importance of network type, rating, location, and state in understanding and predicting call drop occurrences. Further analysis, including cluster analysis and state-wise segmentation, can provide deeper insights and aid in decision-making for improving call quality and reducing call drop rates.
